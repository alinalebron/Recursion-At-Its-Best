# Recursion-At-Its-Best
*Recursion Assignment 7: Java II*
___

Covers the basics of recursive methods using arrays. The purpose is to:

1.	reverseRecurse - reverse the order of the values stored in the array, using this algorithm:  <br><br> Swap the first element value with the last. Then, recursively reverse that portion of the array containing all but the first and last elements

2.	recursiveGetIndexOfLargest - return the index of the largest value stored in the array, using this algorithm:<br><br>  Find the largest value in that portion of the array containing all but the last element.  Compare that value to the value in the last element and return the index of the larger of the two.  

3.	recursiveSort â€“ sort the array in ascending order, using the selection sort algorithm and the recursiveGetIndexOfLargest method you wrote in 2.
